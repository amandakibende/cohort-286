/**
 * This example uses the uuid library from NPM in order to generate unique id's
 * when none are provided either by an API or a JSON file
 *        https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid
 *
 * We also handle differently the selectedFood and its quantity
 * Instead of creating an array of "todaysFood" to differentiate the food
 * that have been selected by a user
 * We add a "selected" (boolean) in order to know if a user has selected a food or not
 * This changes the code a bit from solution nÂ°1
 * We have to update the foods array each time a user selects a food, we need to toggle
 * the "selected" property to true and update the quantity with the quantity the user
 * has selected.
 * Also when we create a new food, we create an id using the uuid library and we add
 * a selected property to it aswell
