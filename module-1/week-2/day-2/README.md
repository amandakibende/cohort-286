# Inheritance

Is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows code reusability when a class includes property (attribute or method) of another class.

# abstraction

means showing just what’s necessary to the outside world and hiding all that is unnecessary-to-be-known. Imagine a car engine - you know it works right, because your car is moving, but how it works, you really don’t have to know.

# polymorphism

means inheriting the method from the parent class but changing its functionality. ex. If you have a class Person and this class has a method move(). If you extend class Child from class Person most likely the child will crawl when you invoke move() method. However, if you extend class Grownup from class Person, they will walk when move() is called. (overly simplified example but just to help you understand.)

# encapsulation

means grouping the data and the methods that manipulate this data together. The goal is to keep them safe from interference and misuse. We have to aim to hide internal implementation and to organize our code as if it is a black box: it should do the job but the rest of the application should not know how they do it. (this is very much connected with abstraction.)
